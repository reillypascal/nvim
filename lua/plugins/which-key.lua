-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
--
-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
--
-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
--  event = 'VimEnter'
--
-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
--
-- Then, because we use the `opts` key (recommended), the configuration runs
-- after the plugin has been loaded as `require(MODULE).setup(opts)`.
---@module 'lazy'
---@type LazySpec
return { -- Useful plugin to show you pending keybinds.
	"folke/which-key.nvim",
	event = "VimEnter", -- Sets the loading event to 'VimEnter'
	opts = {
		-- delay between pressing a key and opening which-key (milliseconds)
		-- this setting is independent of vim.o.timeoutlen
		delay = 0,
		icons = {
			-- set icon mappings to true if you have a Nerd Font
			mappings = vim.g.have_nerd_font,
			-- If you are using a Nerd Font: set icons.keys to an empty table which will use the
			-- default which-key.nvim defined Nerd Font icons, otherwise define a string table
			keys = {},
		},

		-- Document existing key chains
		spec = {
			{ "<leader>d", group = "[D]ebug" },
			{ "<leader>s", group = "[S]earch" },
			{ "<leader>t", group = "[T]oggle" },
		},
	},
}
