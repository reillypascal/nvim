# nvim

My Neovim configuration files. Based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), but broken into individual plugin files and with my own additions and modifications.

[This blog post](https://tickingcode.com/blog/configuring-neovim-from-scratch) from tickingcode.com was helpful in getting things set up.
